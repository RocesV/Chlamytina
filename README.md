### 0. Purpose ###

Chlamytina is a small project focused in the well known green-algae model *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* that tries to answer a common questions in some proteomic/transcriptomic studies: \
\
**Are my molecules of interest epigenetically regulated?** \
\
To fill this gap, we collected all epigenectic files published until the date and developed a new **chromatin states model** including 6mA, 5mC and nucleosome-profile for the first time. Additionally,
an **epigenome-browser** was conducted focusing on the site-specific approach. This tool engage the link-up between proteomic/transcriptomic changes and epigenetic patterns, thus displaying the 
*Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* epi-proteogenomic/epi-transcriptomic landscape.             

### 1. Inputs ###

The data has to be input as a table (first column = ID/Accesions/Names, other columns = different treatment abundance/expression) in .xlsx, .xlx or tab-separated .txt format.

### 2. Installation ###

#### Github #### 

#### Dockerhub (epigenome-browser) ####
