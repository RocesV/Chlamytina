### 0.Purpose ###

Chlamytina is a small project focused in the well known green-algae model *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* that tries to answer a common questions in some proteomic/transcriptomic studies: \
**Are my molecules of interest epigenetically regulated?** \
To fill this gap, we collected all epigenectic files published until the date and developed new chromatin states model including 6mA, 5mC and nucleosome-profile for the first time.
